# Tontine: A Decentralized Staking Protocol

## Overview

Tontine is a decentralized application (dApp) built on Ethereum, designed to offer an approach to staking and earning interest in the DeFi space. The project consists of two main parts: the smart contracts (backend) and the user interface (frontend). This repository contains both the backend and frontend codebases, organized into separate directories for ease of navigation and development.

## Project Structure

- `/backend_tontine`: Contains the smart contracts, deployment scripts, and tests for the Tontine protocol. The backend is built using Hardhat, providing a robust framework for developing Ethereum smart contracts.
- `/frontend_tontine`: The frontend application, developed with React and Next.js, offers a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Tontine protocol. It includes features such as token buying, locking, and staking in two different vaults.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Tontine dApp, please refer to the README files in the respective `backend_tontine` and `frontend_tontine` directories for detailed setup instructions and documentation.

## Features

- **Smart Contract Backend**: Secure and efficient handling of all blockchain interactions, including token management, staking, and interest calculations.
- **Intuitive Frontend**: A seamless user experience for staking ETH, managing TINE tokens, and viewing interest accrual in real-time.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the Tontine project! Please check out the README files in the `backend_tontine` and `frontend_tontine` directories for guidelines on how to contribute to each part of the project.
